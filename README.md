For now, this is very much in draft and so don't want to add too many details. Simply want to remember to give credit:

* champions.json is pulled directly from Riot Data Dragon
* fp-data.csv is a heavily modified sheet of data pulled from OraclesElixer: 2025_LoL_esports_match_data_from_OraclesElixir.csv - Modifications include: 
    * Adding the first 3 bans to the blue team row, creating the "first 6 bans"
    * Removing all players and red side teams, leaving only blue teams
    * Removing all extra data besides first 6 bans and first pick
    * Removing all games above game 1 to prevent fearless drafts from causing additional issues
